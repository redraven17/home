Forward kinematics of a robot refers to the calculation of the position and orientation of its end-effector frame from joint coordinates $\theta$. Open chain systems are the most common forms of manipulator consisting of end-effector actuators being used for day-to-day tasks. Lets review the open chain forward kinematic analysis of end-effectors utilizing manipulator Jacobians as an entity for indicating the capability of the robot.  

__Review of Forward Kinematics__
====== 
Consider the figure presenting a 3R planar open chain. The link lengths are $L_{1}$, $L_{2}$, $L_{3}$ and $L_{4}$ with joint angles $\theta_{1}$, $\theta_{2}$, $\theta_{3}$ and $\theta_{4}$. The Cartesian position $(x,y)$ and orientation $\phi$ of the end-effector as functions of joint angles can be given as-  
<p align="center"><img src="/images/effector.PNG"></p>  

<center>$x = L_{1}cos\theta_{1} + L_{2}cos(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}) + L_{3}cos(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}+\theta_{3})$</center>  
<center>$x = L_{1}sin\theta_{1} + L_{2}sin(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}) + L_{3}sin(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}+\theta_{3})$</center>  

A more systematic method of analyzing kinematics of this open chain is to trignometrically assess the rotation and translation associated to each joint. These can be expressed as a product of four homogeneous transformation matrices-  
<center>$T_{04} = T_{01}T_{12}T_{23}T_{34}$</center>  
where  
<p align="center"><img src="/images/rot.PNG"></p>  

As an alternative to this approach, let us define the $M$ to be the position and orientation of the frame when all joint angles are set to zero.  
<p align="center"><img src="/images/M.PNG"></p>  
Now consider each revolute jont axis to be a zero-pitch screw axis. For instance, consider $\theta_{3}$. If $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ are held at their zero position then the scre axis correspondning to rotation about joint 3 can be expressed as-  
<p align="center"><img src="/images/joint3.PNG"></p>  

This can be comfirmed from visual inspection. Algebraically, $v_{3} = -w_{3} \times q_{3}$ where $q_{3}$ is any point on the axis of joint 3, $q_{3} = [L_{1}+L_{2},0,0]$
Now we can write the homogeneous transformation matrix $T_{04}$ as using the matrix exponential representation-  
<center>$T_{04} = \exp{[S_{3}]\theta_{3}}M$</center>  

Now for $\theta_{1} = 0$ and $\theta_{3}$ at its current position we can analyse the screw motion about joint 2 having angle $\theta_{2}$ as followed-  
<p align="center"><img src="/images/joint2.PNG"></p>  
And the transformation matrix in exponential matrix representation can be written as-  
<center>$T_{04} = \exp{[S_{2}]\theta_{2}}\exp{[S_{3}]\theta_{3}}M$</center>  

Similarly, doing this for joint 1 gives us-  
<p align="center"><img src="/images/joint1.PNG"></p>  
with the final expression for transformation marix expressed as-  
<center>$T_{04} = \exp{[S_{1}]\theta_{1}}\exp{[S_{2}]\theta_{2}}\exp{[S_{3}]\theta_{3}}M$</center>
