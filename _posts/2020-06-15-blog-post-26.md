Before discussing motion planning algorithms, we establish concepts used in
many of them: configuration space obstacles, collision detection, graphs, and
graph search.  

__Configuration Space Obstacles__
======  

Determining whether a robot at a configuration q is in collision with a known
environment generally requires a complex operation involving a CAD model of
the environment and robot. There are a number of free and commercial software
packages that can perform this operation, and we will not delve into them here.
For our purposes, it is enough to know that the workspace obstacles partition
the configuration space C into two sets, the free space Cfree and the obstacle
space Cobs, where $C = C_{free} U C_{obs}$. Joint limits are treated as obstacles in the
configuration space.  

With the concepts of $C_{free}$ and $C_{obs}$, the path planning problem reduces to
the problem of finding a path for a point robot among the obstacles $C_{obs}$. If
the obstacles break $C_{free}$ into separate connected components, and $q_{start}$ and
$q_{goal}$ do not lie in the same connected component, then there is no collision-free
path.  

The explicit mathematical representation of a C-obstacle can be exceedingly
complex, and for that reason C-obstacles are rarely represented exactly. Despite
this, the concept of C-obstacles is very important for understanding motion
planning algorithms. The ideas are best illustrated by examples.  

__A 2R Planar Arm__
======  

Figure shows a 2R planar robot arm, with configuration $q = (\theta_{1}, \theta_{2})$, among
obstacles A, B, and C in the workspace. The C-space of the robot is represented
by a portion of the plane with $0 \leq \theta_{1} \leq 2\pi, 0 \leq \theta_{2} \leq 2\pi$. Remember from
previous posts, however, that the topology of the C-space is a torus (or doughnut)
since the edge of the square at $\theta_{1} = 2\pi$ is connected to the edge $\theta_{1} = 0$; similarly,
$\theta_{2} = 2\pi$ is connected to $\theta_{2} = 0$. The square region of $\mathbf{R}^{2}$ is obtained by slicing the surface of the doughnut twice, at $\theta_{1} = 0$ and $\theta_{2} = 0$, and laying it flat on
the plane.

The C-space on the right side of the figure shows the workspace obstacles A, B,
and C represented as C-obstacles. Any configuration lying inside a C-obstacle
corresponds to penetration of the obstacle by the robot arm in the workspace. A
free path for the robot arm from one configuration to another is shown in both
the workspace and C-space. The path and obstacles illustrate the topology of the
C-space. Note that the obstacles break $C_{free}$ into three connected components.  

__A Circular Planar Mobile Robot__
======  

Figure below shows a top view of a circular mobile robot whose configuration is
given by the location of its center, $(x, y) \in \mathbf{R}^2$. The robot translates (moves without
rotating) in a plane with a single obstacle. The corresponding C-obstacle
is obtained by “growing” (enlarging) the workspace obstacle by the radius of
the mobile robot. Any point outside this C-obstacle represents a free configuration
of the robot.

Figure below shows the workspace and C-space for two
obstacles, indicating that in this case the mobile robot cannot pass between the
two obstacles.

__A Polygon Planar Mobile Robot that Translates__
======  

Figure below shows the C-obstacle for a polygonal mobile robot translating in
the presence of a polygonal obstacle. The C-obstacle is obtained by sliding the robot along the boundary of the obstacle and tracing the position of the robot’s
reference point.

__A Polygon Planar Mobile Robot that Translates and Rotates__
======  

Figure below illustrates the C-obstacle for the workspace obstacle and triangular
mobile robot of previous example if the robot is now allowed to rotate. The C-space is now three dimensional, given by $(x, y, \theta) \in \mathbf{R}^2 \times \mathbf{S}^1$. The three-dimensional
C-obstacle is the union of two-dimensional C-obstacle slices at angles $\theta \in [0, 2\pi )$.
Even for this relatively low-dimensional C-space, an exact representation of the
C-obstacle is quite complex. For this reason, C-obstacles are rarely described
exactly.
