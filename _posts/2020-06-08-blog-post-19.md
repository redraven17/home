Up till now we observed the calculation of robot end-effector's position and orientation for a given set of joint positions. We can now look at velocities of the end-effector and analyze its capability in practical task settings. This is particularly useful for modelling complex control tasks and eliminating redundant joints which may not contribute to the robot's workspace capabilities.  

__Velocity Constraints__

Before considering the case depicted in figure, lets consider the minimal set of coordinates $x \in \mathbf{R}^{m}$ and the velocity is given by $x^{'} = \frac{dx}{dt} \in \mathbf{R}^{m}$. In this case the forward kinematics can be expressed as-  
<center>$x(t) = f(\theta(t))$</center>  
where $\theta$ is a set of joint variables. By the chain rule of time derivatives we have,  
<center>$x^{'} = \frac{df(\theta)}{d \theta} \frac{d \theta(t)}{dt} = J(\theta)\theta^{'}$</center>  
where $J(\theta) \in \mathbf{R}^{m \times n}$ is the Jacobian.  

Now lets have a look at the 2R planar open chain robot presented in the figure with forward kinematics given by-  
<center>$x_{1} = L_{1}cos\theta_{1} + L_{2}cos(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})$</center>  
<center>$x_{1} = L_{1}sin\theta_{1} + L_{2}sin(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})$</center>  

Differentiating both sides w.r.t time gives us-  
<center>$x_{1} = -L_{1}\theta_{1}^{'}sin\theta_{1} - L_{2}(\theta_{1}^{'}+\theta_{2}^{'})sin(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})$</center>  
<center>$x_{1} = L_{1}\theta_{1}^{'}cos\theta_{1} + L_{2}(\theta_{1}^{'}+\theta_{2}^{'})cos(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})$</center>  

which can be rearranged into an equation of the form $x^{'} = J(\theta)\theta^{'}$.  
<p align="center"><img src="/images/eq1.PNG"></p>  
Writing the two columns of $J(\theta)$ as $J_{1}(\theta)$ and $J_{2}(\theta)$ and the tip velocity $x^{'}$ as $v_{tip}$-  
<center>$v_{tip} = J_{1}(\theta)\theta_{1}^{'} + J_{2}(\theta)\theta_{2}^{'}$</center>
As long as $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$ are not collinear, it is possible to generate a tip velocity $v_{tip}$ in any arbitrary direction in the $x_{1}-x_{2}$ plane by choosing appropriate joint velocities $\theta_{1}^{'}$ and $\theta_{2}^{'}$.  On the other hand, if the Jacobian counterparts become collinear, the Jacobian $J(\theta)$ becomes a singular matrix. Such a configuration is called a __singularity__ which is characterized by a situation where the robot tip is unable to generate velocities in certain directions.
