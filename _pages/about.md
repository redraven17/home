<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi! I am an M.A.Sc candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto with <a href="https://www.labs.chem-eng.utoronto.ca/lawryshyn/">Yuri Lawryshyn</a> and <a href="http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/~kostas/">Konstantinos N. Plataniotis</a> and a researcher at RBC Capital Markets. My work is supported by the Edward S. Rogers Graduate Scholarship. I earned my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) from Amity University where I was affiliated as an undergraduate Research Assistant at the Signal Processing and Deep Learning Lab under the supervision of <a href="https://www.amity.edu/aset/departments-ece-Research-Cells-ece-Signal.asp">Rinki Gupta</a>. Besides research, I enjoy reading comic books and novels. Check out <a href="https://karush17.github.io/pull">my pull list for 2020</a>.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">My goal is to understand and build intelligence. I aim to develop intelligent reinforcement learning agents which can reason about the world and solve complex real-world tasks by obtaining abstract knowledge about its components. My current research revolves around the intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning and Robotic Control.</p>
