<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi! I am an M.A.Sc candidate in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto with <a href="https://www.cmte.utoronto.ca/">Yuri Lawryshyn</a> and <a href="http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/~kostas/">Konstantinos N. Plataniotis</a> and a student researcher at RBC. My work is supported by the Edward S. Rogers Graduate Scholarship. I earned my B.Tech from Amity University where I was affiliated as an undergraduate Research Assistant at the Signal Processing and Deep Learning Lab under the supervision of <a href="https://www.amity.edu/aset/departments-ece-Research-Cells-ece-Signal.asp">Rinki Gupta</a>. Besides research, I enjoy reading comic books and novels. Check out <a href="https://karush17.github.io/pull">my comic list for 2021</a>.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">My goal is to understand and build intelligence. I aim to develop intelligent reinforcement learning agents which can reason about the world and solve practical tasks by obtaining abstract knowledge about their components. My current research revolves around the intersection of Energy-based Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Control.</p>
