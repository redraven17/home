<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi! I am a Deep Learning Researcher at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/ca/careers">Huawei Noah's Ark Lab</a> and a Visiting Researcher at the <a href="https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/">Robot Vision & Learning (RVL) Lab</a> with <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/">Florian Shkurti</a>. I completed my M.A.Sc in <a href="https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/">Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> at the University of Toronto with <a href="https://www.cmte.utoronto.ca/">Yuri Lawryshyn</a> and <a href="http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/~kostas/">Konstantinos Plataniotis</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://www.borealisai.com/en/">Borealis AI</a>. My work was supported by the Edward S. Rogers Graduate Scholarship. I earned my B.Tech from Amity University where I was affiliated as an undergraduate Research Assistant at the Signal Processing Lab with <a href="https://www.amity.edu/aset/departments-ece-Research-Cells-ece-Signal.asp">Rinki Gupta</a>. Besides research, I enjoy reading comic books and novels. Check out <a href="https://karush17.github.io/pull">my reading list for 2021</a>.</p>  

<p style="text-align: justify;">I aim to develop intelligent learning systems which can establish a balance between the theoretical uncertainty and practical viability of sequential decision-making and inference. Through this lens, I study the computational principles underlying Energy-based Reinforcement Learning when constrained with limited and safe interactions.</p>
